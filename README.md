## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to produce something akin to an Etch a sketch into a webpage.  The brief is deliberately short as we are expected to plan and research the project ourselves.

The project will require me to generate a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript.  There is then to be a hover effect so that these divs change color when the mouse passes over them.  This will leave a pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would do.

A button at the top of the screen will send the user a popup message asking for a grid size.  Once entered the existing grid will be removed and a replacement grid with the new size will be generated using the same total screen area.  This will be used to generate a new sketch pad. (It is suggested that the grid size be no more than 100 as this can cause processing delays and issues with computer resources).

### Extra Credit ideas

Each hover interaction should randomize the RGB value entirely.

Implement a progressive darkening effect, where each interaction adds 10% more opacity to the square.

## Learning objectives

- Further cement the ability to research and plan more complex projects.
- Learn more about content generation in JavaScript.
- Learn more about CSS styling - especially in Javascript.
